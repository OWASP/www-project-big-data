pitch: The goal of this project is to provide security requirements for Big Data applications

The OWASP Big Data Security Verification Standard (BDSVS) Project is part of the OWASP Big Data Program. As we all hear "data is the new oil" and enterprises are embracing Big Data like never before. A lot of concerns related to storage, transmission, mining, and analyzing data are an even bigger issue when regulation is on the table.

The primary goal of this project is to extend the traditional network security strategy, adding all the necessary levels of security for Big Data Environments, considering the data stages and the nuances the regulations are imposing on this type of project.
